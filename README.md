# Salesforce-Mobile-App-Shortcut

This is a very simple iOS App that has a customized name and icon, and will redirect to the Salesforce Mobile app. For example you may want to have a personalized experience for your users, and not have the Salesforce Mobile Publisher licensing. 



To deploy this to your devices you will have to either push directly with an MDM such as Microsoft inTune, deploy directly on each device or otherwise publish to your App Store. Please note that I have no idea whether this will meet Apple App Store guidelines.

To use this App, just open in XCode and change the name and icons to your company's branding.
